Keep this copy of the basic scene code in case we need to add new scenes later.

class Level extends Phaser.Scene{
  constructor() {
    //sets the name that the program will use for the current level.
    //this becomes important if we have multiple levels using the same template.
    super("Level");
  }
  preload(){
    //bringing in the media assets for the current level
  }
  create(){
    //creating the starting point for the level, loading the assets into sprites, setting up controls for the enemies, and collision detection
    //this is where most of your code will be
  }
  update(){
    //changes that happen on each screen refresh. This is mostly for player controls.
  }
}
