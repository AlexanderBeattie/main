Mark, had asked me to look into FM - Z_RCC_GET_CONNECTION_POINTS for 
Accenture and determine the most used mode as a user has 4 different ways 
they can call it within the FM.

Checked Kibana/Grafana and found that we have no way to tell the difference
as our logs do not show any indictation of the difference between modes. 
Asim also said he doesn't believe it is possible.

Mark had mentioned they should be able to find out from their end through
SAP itself.

SPRING (SECURITY, OAUTH, JWT) -
Adding an error controller / error page to redirect to incase of anything
Adding JWT Token - user logs in with oauth2, JWT token generated then can
use across another API
Added some tests
Added an apicontroller meant that the index page would not be accessible
and needs a JWT token to access it

TO DO - 
Working on css loading for each page
fixing and adding the tests to work with the index page now needing
a token and fully covering the program
Will make sure I fully understand everything and look into signing key 
concepts, expiry tokens etc
