- Wrote down everything I had been doing every week
- Spent the morning looking into different tables on Metabase
and creating example queries to get used to SQL
- Taha gave me example exercise questions for Metabase and Figma 
- Completed the Metabase one that also involved exporting to excel
and creating a graph

-Look into Figma today and do the example q's for that and then test
features I haven't looked at
- Use Kibana to see if I can find logs for things I do eg using Firebase
to topup a test account on SP App and finding that action within Kibana
